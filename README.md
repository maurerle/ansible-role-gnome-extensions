# Ansible Role Gnome Extensions

[![Molecule Test](https://github.com/ctorgalson/ansible-role-gnome-extensions/actions/workflows/molecule.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ctorgalson/ansible-role-gnome-extensions/actions/workflows/molecule.yml)

An Ansible role for idempotently managing Gnome extensions.

For the moment, only supports downloading, enabling, disabling, and removing
Gnome extensions that are available from https://extensions.gnome.org, as well
as enabling and disabling Gnome extensions that have been installed via Apt.

Future plans include adding support for downloading via git.

## Requirements

For obvious reasons, this role requires a host with a Gnome desktop environment.

In addition, the role currently uses Debian/Ubuntu-specific tools.

## Role Variables

### Vars

| Variable name | Required | Default value | Description |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `gnome_extensions_url` | yes | `https://extensions.gnome.org` | The base of the url used to download Gnome extensions. |
| `gnome_packages` | yes | `[{name: 'gnome-shell', state: 'present'}, {'gnome-shell-extensions', 'present'}]` | The packages required on the target host for the role to function in the first place. |

### Defaults

| Variable name | Required | Default value | Description |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `gnome_user`       | yes | `n/a` | The user account to use to install extensions and to install extensions for. |
| `gnome_extensions` | yes | `[]` | A list of items including the url and desired existence/enabled state for each Gnome extension (see below for details). |

#### `gnome_extensions` variable

Each item has variable has three required properties:

| Property name | Required | Type | Accepted values |
|---------------|----------|------|-----------------|
| `url`         | yes      | string  | A url suitable for [ansible.builtin.get_url](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/get_url_module.html) |
| `state`       | yes      | string  | `present` or `absent` |
| `enabled`     | yes      | boolean | `True`, `False`, or [anything ansible regards as 'truthy'](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#conditionals-based-on-variables) |

## Dependencies

The role has no special dependencies. 

## Example Playbook

The following playbook:

  - downloads the [Open Weather](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/750/openweather/) and [Put Windows](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/750/openweather/) extensions and ensures they are
    installed,
  - removes the [Gnome Screenshot Tool](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1112/screenshot-tool/) extension after first disabling it,

```yaml
- name: Manage Gnome extensions.
  hosts: servers
  vars:
    gnome_user: "instance"
    gnome_extensions:
    gnome_user: "instance"
    gnome_extensions:
      - url: "https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/750/openweather/"
        state: "present"
        installed: true
      - url: "https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/39/put-windows/"
        state: "present"
        installed: true
      - url: "https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1112/screenshot-tool/"
        state: "absent"
        installed: false
  tasks:
    - name: "Include ansible-role-gnome-extensions"
      include_role:
        name: "ansible-role-gnome-extensions"
      vars:
        download_only: yes

    - name: "Include ansible-role-gnome-extensions"
      debug: "logoff and logon or restart gnome-shell to reload extensions"

    - name: "Include ansible-role-gnome-extensions"
      include_role:
        name: "ansible-role-gnome-extensions"
      vars:
        download_only: no
```

## Testing

The role is fully tested in Molecule on Docker and verified with Ansible with
two exceptions: enabling and disabling Gnome extensions.

If anybody knows how to get enough of Gnome reproducibly running in Docker so
that I can enable these two things to be tested, please let me know!
